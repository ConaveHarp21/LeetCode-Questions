Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Example 1:
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation:
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) 
    {
        int c=0;
        while(n>1)
        {
            if(n%2==1)
                c++;
            n=n/2;
        }
        return c+1;
    }
}
